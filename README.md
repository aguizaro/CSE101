## Shuffle
This project contains files:
- **Shuffle.c** : &nbsp; Takes a positive integer as a command line argument specifying the maximum number of cards in the deck. The program will then for each n, perform shuffles on the list (0,1,n-1) until the list is back in its original order. The program will print to STDOUT each n followed by the number of shuffles.

- **List.c** : &nbsp; This is the implementation file for the List module.
- **ListTest.c** : &nbsp; This is a test client for the List module.
- **Makefile** : &nbsp; This file is used to build the project.

## Arithmetic
This project contains files:
- **Arithmetic.cpp** : &nbsp; This is the top-level client program that performs basic operations on 2 BigIntegers specified by the given input file. Output is printed to the given output file.
- **List.h** : &nbsp; This is the header file for the List module.
- **List.cpp** : &nbsp; This is the implementation file for the List module.
- **ListTest.cpp** : &nbsp; This is a test client for the List module.
- **BigInteger.h** : &nbsp; This is the header file for the BigInteger module
- **BigInteger.cpp** : &nbsp; This is the implementation file for the BigInteger module
- **BigIntegerTest.cpp** : &nbsp; This is a test client for the BigInteger module.
- **Makefile** : &nbsp; This file is used to build the project.

## Tree Order
This project contains files:
- **Order.cpp** : &nbsp; This program will read in words from an input file and insert them into a Dictionary ADT. The program will then print the in-order string representation of the dictionary, then will print the keys as defined by a pre-order tree walk on the underlying BST.
- **Dictionary.h** : &nbsp; This is the header file for the Dictionary module
- **Dictionary.cpp** : &nbsp; This is the implementation file for the Dictionary module
- **DictionaryTest.cpp** : &nbsp; This is a test client for the Dictionary module.
- **Makefile** : &nbsp; This file is used to build the project.

## Word Frequency
This project contains files:
- **WordFrequency.cpp** : &nbsp; This program will read from an input file and insert each word as a key and its value will be equal to the number of occurrences of that word in the input file. This program will print the Dictionary to an output file.
- **Order.cpp** : &nbsp; This program will read in lines of words from an input file and insert them into a Dictionary ADT. The program will then print the in-order string representation of the dictionary, then will print the keys as defined by a pre-order tree walk on the underlying BST.
- **Dictionary.h** : &nbsp; This is the header file for the Dictionary module
- **Dictionary.cpp** : &nbsp; This is the implementation file for the Dictionary module
- **DictionaryTest.cpp** : &nbsp; This is a test client for the Dictionary module.
